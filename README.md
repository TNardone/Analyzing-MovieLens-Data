# Analyzing-MovieLens-Data

This project was part of a graduate course called Introduction to Data Science. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate use of the R programming language as well as basic data analysis. 

The professor of this course asked that I remove the code from the public version of this repository. Code may be provided by request if it is deemed appropriate.
